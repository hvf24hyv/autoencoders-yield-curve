# Yield Curve Autoencoders

This repository contains the code and model implementations from my master's thesis:  
**"Autoencoders for Yield Curve Modelling"**, University of Copenhagen, 2025.

The project explores various neural network architectures for yield curve reconstruction, including:
- Pure (unconstrained) autoencoders
- Arbitrage-minimizing models
- Arbitrage-free affine models (with 3 ODE solvers)
- A quadratic extension
- An HJM-based arbitrage-minimizing model

## 📁 Structure

- `models/` — model definitions
- `data/` — (placeholder or instructions for where to get data)
- `notebooks/` — training scripts and analysis
- `utils/` — helper functions (plotting, loss functions, etc.)
